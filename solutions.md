Here are direct links to the secrets:

* Secret 1: inside an ordinary commit, easy to find.  
  https://github.com/MickaelFontes/example-dangling-commits/commit/ef1698c39bf379db2ac83d5d8609f831a6f2f32d
* Secret 2: force push inside a merged pull request.  
  https://github.com/MickaelFontes/example-dangling-commits/commit/47d2650b7f81b51614721a1efdb1b9db46c566a6
* Secret 3: force push inside an open pull request.  
  https://github.com/MickaelFontes/example-dangling-commits/commit/caef525eecfb71921805ad380d79cdef20c6286c
* Secret 4: last commit in an open pull request.  
  https://github.com/MickaelFontes/example-dangling-commits/commit/875732b8d753c0d81983f233171f56bfd3da347d
* Secret 5: force push inside a closed and not merged pull request.  
  https://github.com/MickaelFontes/example-dangling-commits/commit/fda6842d7ee95683e8f806612ec3c14138b7ca60
* Secret 6: hardest level, force push inside an ordinary branch with no pull request associated. Can it be found using anything over than last push events on a repository (if the commit is listed)?
